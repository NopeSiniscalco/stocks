# stocks

My attempt at making a stock modeling suite in c?

As of now there is a generator for stocks with random walk algorithm that targets a certain growth and std dev over a certain amount of time, from a certain starting price, and repeats this n times, then graphs!

Graphics are made and displayed using Gnuplot.
